# 8 Week SQL Challenge 
This repository contains answers and solutions to [Danny Ma's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/) 8 week challenge. This challenge tests the understanding of sql data manipulation and also the application of sql to solve real world problems. 
<br>
<br>
This [link](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) redirects you to where the different case studies are, and I encourage anyone to use these problems for SQL practice. 
<br>
I used PostgreSQL as my dba to write SQL queries for this challenge.
